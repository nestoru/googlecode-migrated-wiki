Navigating through [SVN](http://nestorurquiza.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/) you should get code that works. Reading this WIKi and my [Blog](http://thinkinginsoftware.blogspot.com) should be enough to get a feeling of some of those projects I have been involved in and I am able to share.

It is my hope that others while reading will share as well, not only commenting on the subjects here discussed but also pointing to code that works on their own blogs and WIKIs.

Thanks!
